# podcast
This project is for a podcast/ rapper from Orlando Florida.
It was built with Python/Django, and Wagtail cms for the backend. Bootstrap on the front end.

#Installing the project
### I included a requriments.txt file
Pull the project from the repo. I created my environment with python venv. Install the requriments.txt into your venv. 

### Install the requriments.txt
that will install the packages I used on the project makemigrations 
and migrate the database and also create a super user for yourself. 

### Features of this site
As my first production-level wagtail site I added blocks that have embedded players for Youtube as well as Spotify. I plan on adding more features to this site as needed.
